You'd think that, as time goes on with Vault 108, identifying the other Garys by number without referencing anything would've gotten easier. Nope! Now there's just more to remember about each Gary! If anything, it's maybe made things worse!

Gary 102 has been born, and Gary 101 is now of age! 
Gary 015, Gary 008, Gary 045 and I saw him off at the dock. A boat came, and I inquired about it. I smiled, but things were bittersweet The dock says that the boat declined to say where they came from, nor where they were going. They just took a jacket, Gary 101, and left. Only I know about this. We waved at him during his departure. Gary 015 and 008 believe he's left to travel the world. And while that's not immediately false, I don't have any proof for it either. It's supposed to be my job to track them. Well, this isn't making things easy.

After seeing off Gary 101, I headed over to the Vault radio. The radio relay is still silent. I can still communicate with the neighbor islands, but the long-range radio relay hasn't been transmitting for about a year now. There's no telling yet if it'll be back. I hope so, though. 

Sometimes I can hear one of the neighbor islands calling out to it. Silence returns.

I'm sitting here, pushing my pencil across my desk. I'm thinking about little Gary 102. Genetically the same as Gary 042. Will the same happen to her as what happened to Gary 101? If so, I don't know if I'd be able to keep that from Gary 042.
