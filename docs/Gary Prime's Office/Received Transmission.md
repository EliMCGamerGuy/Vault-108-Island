<span style="color: gray;font-style: italic;">"One day, I received a transmission on the vault long-range radio. It was like...an echo. I got in touch with Honesty Island, and they said that they hadn't heard about that transmission for...years. I immediately sent the signal to be transcribed. I record everything that comes through that radio."</span>

Signal 1:
### [[Sindy]]
> *"Mom, dad, Eli's lookalike...It's Sindy! I'm on [[Streetpass Relay Island]] now. Itâ€™s... quiet. I'm just hanging out here for a boat to come take me (illegible). Say hi to everyone for me! I miss you all so much. Love, Sind-"*

<span style="color: gray;font-style: italic;">"The end is just static. Then silence. But for a brief second, we knew she was still out there. Just...waiting. It's clear to see why Toriel and Paper Mario aren't on speaking terms anymore over on Honesty Island. Maybe they blame each other for Sindy's loss. Or maybe, they blame themselves, and can't bear to face each other. But that's prying into personal matters." - Gary Prime</span>
