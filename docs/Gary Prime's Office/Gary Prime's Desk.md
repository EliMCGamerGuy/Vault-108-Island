# Gary Prime's Desk
#hidden
<span style="color: gray;font-style: italic;">(In an offshoot room from the apartments office, you see a messy desk with a lamp, and a nametag reading "</span>[[Gary Prime]]<span style="color: gray;font-style: italic;">." The lamp casts a warm white light all around the room, causing the shadows to be sharper and warmer than they would be otherwise. There's a slightly disorganized pile of documents on Gary Prime's desk. Gary Prime seems to be away, so you pick some of them up. they're tinted rather yellow by the lamp, giving them an aged look. Most of them have fold marks and coffee stains on them.)</span>

<span style="color: gray;font-style: italic;">(In a drawer of Gary Prime's desk, there's a photo of three Garys. They seem to be a family. The middle Gary is slightly smaller. There's sharpie on it saying "Don't forget them.")</span>
